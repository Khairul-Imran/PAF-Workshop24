Note:
- Keep in mind the properties that you would need to input, and what you don't need to input (like those that are auto generated)
- Like auto_incremented id numbers
- And timestamps

You don't have to give these when inserting.

- However, recall that foreign keys would need to be included when inserting. So you will have to figure out how to access the appropriate foreign keys.

For this workshop:
- An order contains multiple order details.
